# Problem Description
It realizes an embedded system *"Home Security System"* to protect home from undesired intrusions. The system is required to manage two different kinds of intrusion detection sensors: area, used to detect people or animals moving inside an area, and barrier, to detect intruders crossing a virtual line. It adopts a PIR sensor for area alarm, LDR sensor for barrier alarm, an active buzzer for alarm sound, a 4x4 keypad for inserting the pin and for managing the system. The behavior of the system, managed by the *STM32F401RE micro-controller*, was programmed through the development set *STM32CubeIDE* and the use of the C language.
